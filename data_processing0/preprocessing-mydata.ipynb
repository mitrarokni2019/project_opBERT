      "the other aspect of this is most people here are depicting'flood risk'as a binary - either you've got it or you don't. everyone has flood risk. everyone. some more than others, for certain, but we all have it. furthermore, 100 year flood plains are considered the'high risk'areas. you're not allowed to build there and you can't get insurance if you do. however, it's not like 100 year flood plains are static. people build developments, the landscape changes, more road, buildings, and parking lots (known as'hardscaping') expand the flood plain. these things have to be re-assessed frequently and fema doesn't have the money to do it everywhere. people who don't live in a 100 year flood plain as the previous maps suddenly find themselves in a flood plain years later because someone built up an area near them. on top of that, climate change is making 500 and 1,000 year flood plains happen more frequently. that means people who are'no where near'the flood plain are getting flooded because the flood event was so much worse than before. this stuff is a lot more dynamic than people like to admit.\n",

      "there is another simple explanation. the basic premises are simple and the supporting data is sound. humans pour insane amounts of c02 into atmosphere. we put enough into the atmosphere that it is changing the climate of the planet. glaciers are melting and have melted. the arctic ocean has measuraby less ice over it (max in winter and min in summer). global average temperatures and ocean temperatures have rising. corals are bleaching en masse. we are impacting the climate of our planet and it's mostly negative. secondarily we are harming the planet directly as well. we clear-cut forests of old growth for agriculture. we divide most large areas where wildlife could live with roads. there is a pile of garbage floating in the middle of the pacific bugger than some states. the number of species we have forced to extinction is astounding. we have polluted chemically and nuclearly by accident and on purpose. we harm the planet in a lot of ways. some people see this as less of a problem than others. there is much potential debate to be had on principle values of progress vs preservation. there isn't much debate to be had on how much co2 is emitted and how much that impacts the climate. 98% of climate scientists or whatever agree. the experts are in consensus. that's not herd behavior that's just the facts after the experts settled (most of) their debates. the real debate is on whether we actually care about that impact and how much of a problem will actually manifest. climate scientists can't predict everything. they can only predict the climate. perhaps some liberties have been taken. i sympathize that there is too much level of alarmism. honestly we need to just take better care of the planet for the sake of taking better care of the planet. climate scientists can't predict how some species will adapt to changing climates. they can't really predict how humans will react to the change in climate either. all of their worst fears for some prediction made could come through and we could just weather it out. in fact whatever comes we will weather it. droughts will come. people will be relocated and rivers will be diverted. forest fires will burn. people will be relocated and such. corals will bleach; not all of them will die but the total amount of coral will be reduced. biodiversity will decrease. all of the stuff will happen and we will weather it. there won't be some climate apocalypse. there won't be a day where everything changes. floods fires and droughts do that to individuals but that already happens. it's just going to happen more. we will pay the price day by day and year by year by seeing an increase in frequency and severity of many difficulties and challenges already faced by people. so basically we can pay to invest in a better future, or we can take the easy way now and pay the upkeep for it later. there won't be some climate apocalypse. there will just be an increasing upkeep cost which will eventually result in some geopolitical event. water scarcity or whatever might the basis of conflict but it won't be the climate wars not to us. some future star trek civilization might look back and be able to say that. to us it'll just be war or some cold conflict where the most militarized nations just hang around in the countries with all the water. like already have international occupations by nato all over the world. we peacekeep everywhere. you honestly think securing water sources will look much different if large scale open conflict were avoided... you honestly think there are no conflicts in the world over water sources already?!\n",

      "i simply cant decide how specifically applicable your comments are. i personally have no insight into the american culture regarding secondary education (which i assume is what is likely being discussed here), but its normal in the country im from for high school students to be educated in statistical and scientific writing, and as a graduation requirement were made to complete and defend a research paper (which has to be good enough to publish in order for us to pass). certainly a lot of students who underwent that process struggled with it, but in my graduating class and in the preceding and succeeding classes, not a single student failed out because of it. they were made to learn it, and at least partially, did. i dont know if culturally thats an impossible expectation of american children, so if my lack of understanding is there i apologize.\n"

I think the average conservative just heard one of their friends, someone who isn't a scientist and doesn't have a good grasp of the data or even really know how to explain the science behind climate change, say something like \"dude we gotta stop driving cars or the world will be over in 10 years\" and they just took that and ran with it.\n",

Did these claims come from respected institutions or at least a person with decent credentials, someone with a degree better than a BS and hopefully employed with the likes of, say, NOAA? Because I doubt it.\n",

I've followed what respected scientists and respected institutions have said about climate change for most of my 38 years of life, and never have I heard them say anything along the lines of the strawmen that conservatives regularly state, things like \"the world will LITERALLY END in X years\" or putting world-ending timelines on a scale of something like a couple of decades. The very foundation of your argument is built on a false premise at best and a complete lie at worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind, respected scientists HAVE said things along the lines of \"in 10-20 years, we could reach a *point of no return*\", which is NOT the same as saying \"the world is, at this point in time, literally over and done with\", but it IS saying that we've reached a point where it will no longer be possible to save ourselves. We can reach a \"point of no return\" in a timeline of 10-20 years and still have another 100-200 years until the consequences of that become so severe that people start to die simply because of how inhospitable the planet is, but clearly that's saying something very different, right?\n",

      "Conservatives, convince me that you've ever actually been told this doom-and-gloom from a RESPECTED source and I'll take this seriously. But it is currently my view that anyone parroting this line of \"oh but they've told us the WORLD WILL END IN 10-20 YEARS\" is just parroting bullshit that was never said by an expert and is ultimately just a strawman you've conjured up to excuse yourselves from having to take climate change seriously.

      "i only say americans because i am one and dont know enough about the culture outside america enough to make judgements. climate change will cause terrible environmental changes that will cause millions to die/suffer from flooding, food shortages, etc. this will come to head in the coming decades. this is a fact. to solve climate change we need to emit less co2 in the atmosphere. we can do that in america: 1. eliminating single use plastics: -buying food at refillerys -using glass and aluminum drinks -companies will be fined/stoped for using wasteful plastic packaging -right to repair will be law 2. banning the use private vehicles: -every has to take the bus, train, or bike (unless they have great reason not to) -the rich cant use private planes -banning new gas vehicles 3. nationalizing, regulating, rationing public utilities: -utilities will be free but rationed depending on need -coal and natural gas power plants will only be used if renewables cant (edit: im obviously down for nuclear) -anyone using too much ultilities will be fined/stopped -helping other countries under americas influence do the same -banning single family detached housing -banning new housing too far outside a urban center doing this in america by itself will mitigate climate change greatly but most americans are too self-involved to give up cars and single family houses. edit: -banning new single family detached housing -for private vehicles small scale electric recreation vehicles are allowed edit 2: wow, this post got a lot of attention. most people got caught up in the car thing. i specifically said unless you have a great reason. i didnt say we are rounding up everyones cars and destroying them. just the idea of using public transportation made many people visceral angry. (i also dont appreciate the insults in my messages) that proved my point, many people wouldnt change for the good of society. these measures if taken seriously would have to be done in like 10 year timeline. but for them to be done at all some people will have to sacrifice their time and comfort. most people rather say climate change isnt real or china is the problem. before we criticize other countries lets look at our selves. i understand we need regulations to fully do these things but why would regulations come if it looks like nobody cares. also not all these things have to be done right away at one time. long story short the sentiment i got from everyone is: fuck you, im not changing it makes my life harder instead of those solutions are drastic but im going to start making changes so we start a movement that starts mitigating the worse effects of climate change and pollution. and that was my problem p.s. many people also mentioned we need to limit our use of meat, i agree.\n"

that's all biocapacity is. it is a measure of how many resources earth has, has quickly natural resources replenish, and how quickly we use them. a positive biocapacity means we use resources slower than earth replenishes them. you are welcome to dispute the laws of physics. the assumptions put into your concept are'bunk'. resources may be finite, but trying to claim a specific'capacity'is nothing but a politically motivated idea for what you think should be the case. i can cite the paper that listed the carrying capacity of the earth at a billion-billion people based on thermodynamics. what you are trying to refer to is'carrying capacity'and there is not a good means to define that for humans since we can readily transport resources across vast distances and we can actively modify an environment to suit us. restoration of habitats. repopulation of species. decarbonization. restoration to what? why is that the'correct'habtitat? seriously. why is a specific choice better than another? decarbonization tells me what i need to know about your'politics'. fun fact - co2 levels are lower now than they have been the planets geologic history. why is it needed to'lower'them? explain to me why exactly this value you want is more correct than a previous level in the planets history? you should be able to do this if you are demanding it. quite the opposite. the problem is that our position in the ecosystem is unbalanced because we have broken free of the state of nature. the planet is the way it is. we either work within the physical limitations of that system or not. we have chosen not to. this is a total line of bull. we are part of nature and completely incapable of'breaking nature'. everything we do is'natural'. good, bad, otherwise, we are part of the planets ecosystems. yes, but we won't. humans have proven to be one of the most adaptable animal yet to exist on the planet. probably the most adaptable if you limit the list to larger creatures. there is little reason to believe we wouldnt survive. no way. it would have been catastrophic for europe and caused immense damage to humanity. plants and then animals would relatively quickly reclaim those places as we saw in the containment zone. where human activity ceases, ecological recovery occurs. i don't think you understand just how dangerous the event was and what could have happended should that reactor have melted down through the containment and exploded when it hit groundwater. as for recovery - if you include dna damage - sure. but if it actually went to the'worst case'possible, it would have been a mass extinction event for much of the world. a. says the one who is disputing the laws of physics. b. you are literally disputing facts. chernobyl ecosystems'remarkably healthy what does it mean to your credibility when you dispute demonstrable facts without evidence? saying something does not make it true. as for remarkably healthy - sure. never mind the dna damage and the fact humans won't be able to live there for tens of thousands of years. that eating anything grown there is injesting poison. yea - i am the one who is denying physics........ people do all the time. parents have children. children care for their parents. people pay taxes. people live and thrive in systems that limit their quality of life. you are just not willing to make sacrifices for the future of your species and all species. you are entitled to take that position, you should just be open about it. no - people don't give up quality of life all the time. having children is seen as improving quality of thier lives. you are nuts if you think people are going to merely accept your demands. you don't even need to take my word for it. see how far the'green'movement has gotten worldwide with its pet projects. if it is a quality if life issue - it doesn't happen. capitalism had caused the greatest loss of species in all of human existence, a rate of loss comparable to when a meteor destroyed the dinosaurs. we literally call this the sixth extinction. the 5th was the cretaceous-tertiary extinction. you cannot attribute that to captitalism when some of the worst ecological offenders are communist countries. although - they did result in something like 100 million dead humans last century so that could be twisted into some warped idea of good thing if you are a eco-zealot. what do you think the quality of life is on a planet with dead oceans, little arable land, and a global center that indefinitely exceeds the wet bulb temperature? i don't care what ideology underlies the drive for sustainability. it's just clear that the need of capitalism for unlimited growth is the cause of the problem. capitalism and sustainability are simply incompatible. a society cannot grow indefinitely when resources are limited. it must achieve a state of balance with its ecosystem. every collapse of a civilization was caused by this simple oversight. ours will inevitably follow if we do not learn from history or science. i've heard it all before. deadlines that come an go without any it every happening. chicken little - the sky is not falling. we are not on the verge of all dying off. if you want the best solution to solving complex large scale problems - it has been capitalism. a system that works on the underlying human nature. that is what will succeed. your desire to fight human nature is a fools errand - proven time and again to fail in the real world. i notice how you never acknowledge this. you don't have a viable option to suggest. you just want to rail against the as of yet - best form of economic system yet developed. do yourself a favor - get a little context and stop believing the zealots who are preaching doom/gloom and the end of the world. you'll be much happier in the long run.\n"
