              "'You’re not quite thinking about this the right way.\\n\\nThe United States is responsible for 15% of global emissions, Europe another 15%. China is 30%, the rest of world is another 40% and growing.\\n\\nThe US and Europe might be able to agree on things like the Paris Accords to try to cut their emissions by 50%, but they haven’t been effective to date. \\n\\nEven if the US and Europe hit the Paris goals, it just translates to a cut of 15% globally. That’s not enough according to more dire projections… and worse yet, the developing world is likely to increase its emissions by that much in the same time period.\\n\\nSo if you want to hit 10–20 year goals around point of no return, you must address the developing world… and there are no viable solutions proposed.\\n\\nLiberals will simultaneously argue that we need to make rapid climate change progress while also suggesting the developing world will come to the table once they modernize and raise their standards of living. Cool, but doing so will cause tremendous amounts of emissions in the meantime and probably puts us on a 50-100 year timeline before they turn the corner into reduction.\\n\\nEffectively you can believe one of two things:\\n\\n* A 50-100 year timeline is OK to address climate change. That’s about the amount of time we need for the developing world + banking on not yet realized technology breakthroughs.\\n* Climate change is more dire, and we need much more progress in 10-20 years. That necessitates major austerity from developed nations, as well as a real answer to the developing world… and its somewhat hard to arrive at any conclusion than a Thanos like strategy of lowering global population fairly rapidly.\\n\\nThe distinction between 10-20 years being a point of no return for long term damage & risk of negative feedback loops vs a rapid apocalypse isn’t the real issue here. \\n\\nThe real issue is that liberal interpretations of data do not match their policy advocacy, and a lot of yelling about a problem that feels unactionable will eventually turn into apathy.'"

            "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr {'sequence': 'so some people have pointed out good points below me but they just did so like assholes which doesnt help. please read my reply and im more than happy to have civil conversations about this or any subject. i am a scientist a phd in biomedical sciences specifically viruses and the immune system. you are right there are a lot of scientists on a high horse no doubt. there are also scientists who forgot that good science is trying to disprove your theory and through failing to disprove your theory you suggest your theory is correct. these shortcomings come from the fact that scientists are people too and we all fail in the same ways especially on topics we are experts in. much of these conflicting studies you have heard about are wildly misrepresented by a media empire that relies on clicks. headlines like new model suggests theres a 40 chance covid came from a lab leak 35 chance its from raccoon dogs and 25 chance something else doesnt catch the attention that a headline like scientists confirm lab leak is most probable source of covid. both headlines are correct but the second implies scientists are confident they found the source of covid when in fact they arent. these headlines usually lead to articles written by people who at best skimmed the science found papers that they think support their own bias and then further skew the scientists work by writing what they hope the scientists said. unfortunately there arent good media sources to learn about science be it viruses climate change you name it. science is complicated and specialized and takes a long time to explain nuances. americans dont have the attention span not because theyre stupid or anything but because we all have a lot on our plates right now and simply cant devote tons of attention to every important piece of information no matter how important. my recommendation is to look for broad consistency. in your example there are flip flopping papers on the health benefit of winecoffeeetc. so ignore it. youre right those subjects flip flop regularly. but when it comes to something like climate change id ask you to look a little deeper into the headlines. youre right the models are frequently wrong especially in their timeframes. but notice the headlines are all climate change will be catastrophic in 5102050etc years. they all agree climate change is happening and will be catastrophic just not on the timeframe. this suggests there is a scientific consensus that we have a problem and its more refining our understanding of that problem that is contested. much of that comes from us increasingly understanding complex elements of our environment. if you want to learn about a specific science subject try googling the subject and review. a review is a synthesis of many research papers into basically a book chapter by one or more scientists. if the subject is biomedical sciences pick something listed from ncbi this is a large repository of all tax payer funded research. so if you wanted to learn more about long covid for example youd google long covid review and read as many articles from ncbi as you can find in that google search. put more weight on newer sources and sources that liberally use phrases like remains unknown or requires further study as they are more likely to be attempting a balanced report of the body of data. wikipedia is a great source as well for learning what specific science terms mean. ill conclude with my impression of climate change research as a scientist. countries along the equator are going to be very hard hit in large part from excessive heat  humidity killing people and a lack of water. countries further north will experience localized issues like increased major storms that will cause significant damage and loss of life to certain states in america like tx fl ca and the gulfeastern seaboard. these stressors alone will not end human society we arent going to suddenly all be living in the sahara or washed away in storms and wildfires. but the quality of life will decrease certain areas will become uninhabitable vulnerable populations young old poor will die in larger numbers and massive immigration crisis will impact nations where refugees flee to. if we use gas until it runs out around 2050 i think but not sure we will cease to be able to make most pharmaceuticals and plastics. if wildfires continue to get larger and harder to contain we will see large increases in children with asthma and adults with copd and emphysema. there are a myriad of little things that will add up leading to political instability if you think the board crisis is bad now imagine when central america as a whole is fleeing uninhabitable land. we know these things will happen with the overwhelming majority of scientists agreeing its just when they will happen nobody can agree on because we keep learning more about major features of global climate and the impacts humans are having on them. i personally would recommend the book parable of the sower. the book itself is a bit weird and preachy and you dont have to finish it but it has a pretty good representation of how i envision america after significant climate change occurs.', 'labels': ['similarity', 'knowledge', 'trust'], 'scores': [0.4130781888961792, 0.4017702639102936,

assuming most americans had access to public transportation networks from their homes and offices there remains a multitude of issues that need to be resolved. streets have to be built to be safer for walking and biking. walking and biking are important transportation options for journeys that are relatively close to home and can also serve as a lastmile mode of transportation from the bus terminals back to homes. however being a pedestrian in the us is arguably not safe. despite the fall in driving due to the pandemic pedestrian deaths have spikedhttpswww.ghsa.orgresourcesnewsreleasesghsapedspotlightaddendum21 by some 21 in 2020 despite a fall in driving by about 42. there is a lack of protected bike lanes i.e. a barrier separating the car lanes and bike lanes so protecting regular pedestrians from vehicles is necessary for americans to switch away from driving. likewise other measures such as lowering the curb radius or converting 1214 foot wide driving lanes to 10 foot laneshttpswww.bloomberg.comnewsarticles20150728anewstudyfindsthat10foottrafficlanesaresaferandstillmoveplentyofcars are important in ensuring that walking and biking are safe options. do such measures matter in changing americans behavior? yes it seems. the statistics herehttpswww.peopleforbikes.orgstatisticseconomicbenefits could be of insight. in particular philadelphia has seen a marked 96 increase in number of bikeshttpswww.phila.gov20220401philadelphiaparkingseparatedbikelanestudy when measures to enhance safety had been implemented in 2021. it seems that americans value their safety and arguably their lives above that of climate change. would you say that these people dont care enough about climate change because they do not put it above their lives? another important issue is the effectiveness of public transport in the us. if your proposal got implemented that would mean millions of people would have to start using the public transport system. the system would quite simply be overloaded. imagine long queues at the bus stops and endless waiting times for the buses to arrive because prior buses were already packed. the key issue is that for such a change to occur the transportation systems must improve markedly. if the wait times are about 30 minutes for the buses would you say that americans do not care enough about climate change because they would have to waste an hour or two daily waiting for transport risk being significantly late for their commitments? there cannot be accurate waiting times provided if the system is completely overloaded to resolve this then the government must provide funding and resources to help the transportation system. you mention elsewhere that americans do not vote for those politicians that advocate for certain policies. however the recent bipartisan infrastructure bill shows that both parties do not seem to support this. 39 billion meant for public transportation 11 billion for road safety also was dwarfed by the 110 billion meant to help build roads bridges and other major projects. without this funding then the public transport systems will never be usable by so many americans.  3. nationalizing regulating rationing public utilities utilities will be free but rationed depending on need coal and natural gas power plants will only be used if renewables cant anyone using too much ultilities will be finedstopped helping other countries under americas influence do the same banning single family detached housing banning new housing too far outside a urban center assuming americans agree with the spirit of such a proposal there seems to be a multitude of unintended consequences that will arise. what defines need? what would be the benchmark used? these are issues that we have to tackle with which could give rise to worse energy inequalities. finingstopping people from using too much utilities could lead to the creation of an energy black market  which requires even more regulation  is this feasible?

toxigenic  carcinogenic chemicals that dont even have a half life plus the radiation they were scared of in the first place? offer something that isnt dumb that has a chance to help  youll find people getting on board. offer something effective efficient pragmatic  fair then you can complain if no one bites. something like a revenue neutral carbon tax. climate change  greenhouse gasses are a complicated problem without a silver bullet solution every approach comes with upsides and downsides alike including downsides that meaningfully harm societies most vulnerable people. a very straightforward program where carbon is taxed when it is pulled from the ground or imported into the country would address the biggest issue of emissions that all the pollution  its costs are externalized meaning those who profit from pollution receive 100 of the benefit but the harm  consequences are distributed across the world  all people to share equally. this makes polluting more a pragmatic  responsible business decision  going out of your way to pollute less an irresponsible one. the carbon tax puts some of these costs which are externalized back on the balance sheet of those who pollute. this will of course raise prices of some goods note the tax doesnt have to be 100 of the externalized costs to be effective which will hurt everyone who buys things  harm our most vulnerable the most. to compensate for this harm all the proceeds collected by a carbon tax will be redistrubuted back to all americans equally. the people who conserve the most  consume the least will break even or end up revenue positive. the people conserve the least  consume the most will bear more of the costs. benefits  this is a simple concept that is easier to communicate to the public than most alternatives.  this simplicity makes it harder to game we live in a time where the richest people  companies very often know how to game a system  offload the expenses onto people who dont know how or arent willing to play. carbon credits cap  trade  all the other suggestions ive heard always have persverse  unintented consequences while making our already impossibly complex tax codes  regulations even more complicated. a solution that causes more problems than it fixes is not ideal.  this tax is visible at every level of the economy from production to distribution to store shelves which means it can tip the scales on every economic decision from less efficientmore polluting to more efficientless polluting options.  the tax is fine tunable it can start at a trivial amount while people adjust to the idea  kinks are worked out then slowly be ramped up until an optimal balance is reached with advance notice of years or even decades.  people can sacrifice according to their individual needs  priorities if they do give up straws today they can do so without empowering those who come with the next round of demands. tldr the problem isnt that people dont care  arent willing to sacrifice. the problem is that the ship is steered by fools who havent earned peoples trust  respect who are likely to cause at least as much harm as good. your heavy handed list is a grand example. putting punishment above pragmatism  asking people to give up their comfort freedom  dignity while they know everything they give up will be captured by those rich enough to buy  exploit loopholes not just to ignore the law but to get richer by it.', 'labels': ['trust', 'knowledge', 'similarity'], 'scores': [0.3501295745372772, 0.3344653248786926, 0.31540510058403015]}\n",
