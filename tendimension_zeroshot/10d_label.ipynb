            "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr {'sequence': \"did some digging and found this comment which i'll quote here: data on the topic is not systematically collected, and research is limited. what is available requires careful interpretation. generally speaking, the police is not an easily accessible population, and there is a lack of national efforts. existing data collection does not allow to discern the proportion of what is called officer-involved domestic violence. to reiterate, there have been some studies here and there. however, findings are not entirely consistent. keep in mind: 1. methods vary (e.g. how'domestic violence'is defined and how data are collected); 1. police agencies, and their (sub)cultures, vary. for example, it is reasonable to expect different rates depending on which police department is studied (size, region, urban/non-urban, state, country, etc.); 1. prevalence and incidence can vary depending on when data was collected (what was true 20 years ago may not be equally true today). for illustration, erwin et al.( observe in 2005: however, epidemiological data on the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for ipv among police officers are lacking. under-reporting may also be an issue since there are many disincentives for reporting police-related domestic violence, including the loss of income and medical benefits if the officer is terminated from the force. while data on ipv in police families are sparse, there is evidence that they may have a number of potential risk factors for ipv ... and stinson and liederbach( in 2013: the notorious brame shooting and initiatives to address the problem have clearly worked to increase public awareness and establish oidv as an issue of importance for criminal justice scholars and practitioners; however, the movement to recognize and mitigate violence within police families has thus far failed to produce much in the way of specific empirical data on the phenomenon. there are no comprehensive statistics available on oidv, and no government entity collects data on the criminal conviction of police officers for crimes associated with domestic and/or family violence. some police agencies presumably maintain information on incident reports of domestic violence within the families of police employees, but these data are usually the property of internal affairs units and thus difficult or impossible to access (gershon, 2000). there have been a small number of studies based on data derived from self-administered officer surveys that estimate the prevalence of oidv; but, the self-report method is limited by the tendency to provide socially desirable responses, as well as the interests of officers to maintain a code of silence to both protect their careers and keep episodes of violence within their families hidden from scrutiny. researchers tend to agree with the following: there is a problem, but there is an important need for more research. the 40% highlighted by the oft cited (now defunct) national center for women and policing( does refer to research, however see the preamble to this post. they cite a 1991 congressional testimony, and an academic article published in 1992. these are decades old snapshots. it is like taking crime rates from the early 90s to speak of crime today( another caveat to keep in mind is that these studies did not involve national samples. most researchers studied a single department, often situated in urban settings. it is unclear how representative any of these findings are at a national scale. --- returning to erwin et al.: one small study conducted in 1992 found that the rate of ipv in police families might be as high as 25% (neidig et al., 1992). in this study, neidig et al. suggested that ipv in police families is well known to police supervisors and police psychologists, yet remains understudied because it is generally hidden by police departments (neidig et al., 1992). another study suggested that as many as 2040% of police officer families experience domestic violence, in contrast to 10% of the general population, (u.s. department of justice, 2000). however, in our large ipv survey, which was anonymous, we obtained a rate of physical abuse of approximately 7% (gershon et al., 1999). and in a small sample (n48) of female spouses of police officers also surveyed as part of that study, 8% reported being physically assaulted, (gershon, 1999). the findings of gershon and colleagues in 1999 can be found in the report for project shields( conducted in 1997-1999 with 1100 full sworn officers from the baltimore police department who self-administered the questionnaires. the aforementioned congress testimony was provided by leanor boulin johnson (pdf)( in 1991, concerning findings from eight years prior. they surveyed a sample of 728 patrol officers and 479 spouses drawn in 1983 from two moderate-to-large east coast departments: we found that 10 percent of the spouses said they were physically abused by their mates at least once during the last six months prior to our survey. another 10 percent said that their children were physically abused by their mate in the same last six months. how these figures compare to the national average is unclear. however, regardless of national data, it is disturbing to note that 40 percent of the officers stated that in the last six months prior to the survey they had gotten out of control and behaved violently against their spouse and children. the 1992 study is by neidig, russell and seng( the subjects were volunteers attending in-service training and law enforcement conferences in a southwestern state. three hundred eighty-five male officers, 40 female officers and 115 female spouses completed an anonymous survey on the prevalence and correlates of marital aggression in law enforcement marriages. their conclusion: by self-report, approximately 40% of the officers surveyed report at least one episode of physical aggression during a martial conflict in the previous year with 8% of the male officers reporting severe violence. the overall rates of violence are considerably higher than those reported for a random sample of civilians and somewhat higher than military samples. the rates reported by a sample of the officers'wives were quite consistent with the officers'self-reports. now, one might be confused by the fact that erwin et al. cited this study while affirming that the rate of ipv in police families might be as high as 25%. the discrepancy concerns what data is described. neidig et al. found that 41% of their law enforcement sample reported any violence by either partner over the last 12 months. however, the prevalence rate of male officers self-reporting any kind of physical aggression was 28%, whereas the the prevalence rate reported by spouses was 33%. --- first, i will reiterate that a problem exists. the point of this reply is to highlight difficulties with establishing the extent of the problem, and to invite taking into account also when particular numbers have been collected, among other details. consider, for example, that tolerance for these behaviors and social awareness about (and reactions to) these behaviors have not remained static in these past decades. after all, these are behaviors which have been increasingly stigmatized. it is therefore not unlikely that the prevalence has declined since the 1980s and 1990s, regardless of other caveats (e.g. under-reporting), or which method we consider produced more valid and reliable results. it is also not at all implausible for the prevalence of these behaviors to be declining slower relative to the rest of the population. there are multiple studies (including those cited) establishing risk factors specific to police careers which are associated with oidv. it is also worthwhile to consider the following criticism: police departments appear to have taken fewer steps to address domestic violence committed by their members than recommended by (e.g.) the international association of chiefs of police. to quote erwin et al.: yet, according to one survey of police departments serving populations over 100,000, only 55% of the departments had specific policies in place for dealing with officer-involved ipv (u.s. department of justice, 2000). also see lonsway( 2006 study concluding that only a minority of 78 large national police agencies had provisions regarding officer-involved domestic violence. --- p.s.: the above was not meant to be exhaustive. see mennicke and ropes( 2016 review: seven articles met the inclusion criteria, offering a range of 4.840% of officers who self-report perpetrating domestic violence with a pooled rate of 21.2%. discrepancies in prevalence rates may be attributable to measurement and sampling decisions. for information, 2 were published in 2012. blumenstein et al.( sampled 90 officers from southern us agencies and found a prevalence of 12.2%. oehme et al.( sampled 853 florida officers and found a prevalence of 28.6%. --- edit (august 30, 2020): for further discussion, see this thread( credit to u/revueofzero\", 'labels': ['similarity',

(no prizes for guessing what happens there) the type of weapon used and the extent of victim injuries influenced criminal case outcomes. officers were seldom convicted on any offense in cases where they had used their hands/fists as a weapon (45.8% convicted). criminal convictions were more likely when the arrested officer used other body parts as a weapon (87.0% convicted) or a personally-owned gun (87.5% convicted). table 4 also demonstrates that there is an association between conviction on at least one offense charged and the seriousness of a victims injuries. officers were rarely convicted when their victim experienced minor injuries (36.0% convicted), but convictions were more common when there were serious injuries (82.9% convicted) or fatal injury (87.5% convicted). so if they beat their kid to death, they are likely to be convicted, but if they smack their kid around a few times with their fists they're likely to get off. and of the 233 cases where the disposition was known, 152 of them they retained the cop. and interestingly: some of the behavior described in the news articles did not result in either an official charge that corresponded to the nature of the underlying act perpetrated by the arrested officer or any type of criminal conviction. there were 20 cases in which the most serious offense charged was not even an assault-related offense, although the news article(s) described behavior that clearly constituted domestic and/or family violence under the aafp definition. simple assault was the most serious offense charged in over 40% of the cases (n 132); however, these officers were also commonly charged with lesser offenses (e.g. intimidation/harassment, disorderly conduct, obstruction of justice) that could be used during subsequent plea negotiations as a means to avoid an assault-related conviction and associated penalties under the lautenberg amendment. so no, they do not make a strong effort to punish their own, unless someone is heavily injured or dies. most of the time the person remains a law enforcement officer, and plenty of times they draw down the blue wall of silence. and these are in cases that draw media attention, they reduce the charges below the level of assault, allow the officer to continue to carry a gun, and keep employing them. so do you trust the statistics from law enforcement on how well they police themselves?\", 'labels': ['status', 'similarity', 'conflict', 'trust', 'knowledge', 'support', 'power', 'fun', 'identity', 'romance'], 'scores': [0.19774574041366577, 0.19706590473651886, 0.14481116831302643, 0.13359040021896362, 0.10786425322294235, 0.07494596391916275, 0.07317325472831726, 0.03941360116004944, 0.025862129405140877, 0.005527529865503311]}\n",

            "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr {'sequence': \"i think i'll probably start by agreeing with you on a point: all universities shouldn't require all university professors to promote these goals. and indeed, they don't. some specific universities and departments within those universities do. and here's the thing: actually, this is something that is a tangible thing that universities can do to promote their own interests. put this another way: do you think it's necessarily wrong for economists, or foreign policy experts to compete on political grounds? when the new republican leader becomes president, you want them to turn to your organisation, your experts, your advisors, your alumni. when the dems are looking for how to manage the economy, you want them to turn to your university. maybe even to recruit from your university. otherwise, you can churn out all the papers you want, you can try and be the experts on any given field, and if nobody ever listens, you're not really a field of economics, are you? or politics? or foreign policy? certainly that's not bringing in the grants. likewise, psychology is an important field. but you want your psychologists, and your experts to be the people that are consulted on mental health, and how to manage that on a societal level. so, it's absolutely in their interests to work out how to achieve something like that on an academic level. also, if that's their aims, it would be fantastic to point out oh yeah, and it turns out that being poor, you're more likely to have this problem, and we think we're interested in solving that. something like that can make the whole school suddenly respected just for having something to say. and you can argue that the pudding is being over-egged a little. and you could be right about that. the question is whether anyone thinks someone as esteemed and well-respected as jonathan haidt is going to seriously struggle to find a job. if enough people like that say fuck it, i'm moving to texas (idk what the universities there are like) then you're going to have an obvious crisis of academia, and of skills. the commercial and academic realities of that will just shift the skills around and therefore those universities lose. so, even if this is a poor management decision, then the reality is that it's not that poor a management decision. people aren't really moving to texas. even if you think there's an issue, there's not that much of an issue. and if it were that poor of a management decision, then the universities that didn't make those decisions would win. also, jonathan haidt is being a reactionary. it's just as easy to be a conservative and say look, this is how society is working right now, and my work is trying to help everyone. it's just as easy to say well, if you give to the rich, then everyone benefits when the growth happens. just because your facts wouldn't help society on any level, and would worsen the impact on diversity, inclusion, and so on and so forth, you can argue pretty much anything any way you want it to. and he knows that, and he could give any answer that he wanted. also, this is a networking event, and an event that maybe affects how much funding the department gets next year. even if you kind of resent that this is your job, you're not going to be doing it any differently anywhere else. this is the kind of basic requirement that any academic position has. and maybe this isn't the conference to send jonathan haidt to. maybe he's struggling a little because he's just not super into all this social justice stuff, and he doesn't regard what he does as working for that aim. perhaps he's happier sucking corporate dick at a right wing university, because he knows how to speak conservative. maybe it's an academic trend that like, working at a conservative university, as long as you say the right things, kind of is more fun, because you never really worry about what you say, you just have to have dinner with some rich old guy who honestly would just prefer to have dinner and enjoy himself and doesn't give a shit what you do. ok, great. go to a different conference. or get a different job. and perhaps his work isn't considered the cutting edge in the field and besides which his political views and social analysis don't really mesh with what people in the field are doing. well, he's got no more right than any other research scientist to have a great career. the truth is that everything goes through trends, and a lot of research scientists go unknown in their time, only to be suddenly discovered when that particular view of the world takes off. and lots never have their moment. i can't help feeling that a lot of this stuff just is outright ignorant or outright claiming falsehoods about academia. it's not unusual for a university department to have certain priorities, and certain interests, and certain goals. you don't take issue with the fact that the economics department at this university seems to want to promote a neoliberal framework, or a libertarian one. it's not considered an affront to be asked to court republicans. the robotics department isn't crying because they have to demonstrate value to corporate donors. the medicine department doesn't freak out because they can get more funding for curing specific illnesses because big pharma knows it can make more money like that. all these things probably don't meet everyone's ideals, but that's how the industry works. and maybe if you want to promote the interests of a certain worldview, or take down those who promote an opposing one, then your side of the argument should start caring about this particular field. give money to people who'll do the kinds of research you want them to, promote politically and economically these ideas, and make that a major part of your side's viewpoint. otherwise, you're asking people to talk to nothing, get nothing for it, and then see nothing happen as a result of it.\", 'labels':

that's like saying that liberals are all blue-haired women with instagram profiles. there's a correlation, but no inhernet connection. one could make the same correlation between black people and crime, and again, this kind of discrimination is what we, as a society decided was immoral. inherently, and not on a case-by-case basis. that anyone who might have any reasons to vote for trump must have women (or any other boogeyman generalization and lack of nuance in the perception of other people) is nonsense. racism and being against immigration correlates too, but that doesn't mean that they're the same. i am a minority in that i'm neurodivergent. i get no sympathy points for this unless i appeal to herd morality in some stupid way. which i can do, if i want to, it's just such a stupid game is all. i want human rights to be respected. i want to promote free thought and discussion. these two values deduce to everything else i've written here. freedom to safety - being against assulting people. assaulting people that the majority are against is the issue. lynching against black people were made possible by the same things which make lynching against pedophiles possible today. if something is unpopular, the majority will not defend it, and you can get away with treating it badly. this is true whenever we talk about reddit now, or nazi germany of the past. the values that i propose are the only effective treatment against this problem in general. your values make both situations possible. mine make none of the two possible. you want just one of them, i realize that they're boolean (like human rights) your simultaneously arguing for a communist government and a libertarian one not at all. the individual is the ultimate minority. a victimless crime is not a crime. humans have poor judgement so judgement should be left to the courts. one has the right to ignore others, to dislike them, and even to make mistakes and believe wrong things. problems can still happen in this system, so we propose two values: tolerance as good and understanding as good. what makes immoral behaviour possible is distance, meaning mental distancing, self-delusion, and even writing on the internet as opposed to in person (as other people are reduced to mental concepts, dehumanized) all wisdom is understanding. with understanding, tolerance increases. the ability to put oneself in others shoes is reverse correlated with the ability to hate them and treat them badly. through the media, various ideologies perceive other ideologies through a biased media, which warps reality. google should be unbiased for the same reason that phone directory should be unbiased, and for the same reason that your car shouldn't refuse to drive just because you said something stupid. surely the concept of staying in ones own lane is familiar to you, because even as an attorney you have one specific job. universities, too, have specific functions - teach. and google - show me what i search for (not what they want to search). this too, calls for protections which go alone with the roles. google should not be held responsible for indexing bad sites. i value good design. equality is also good design. capitalism (with its limitations) is also good design. communism is bad design, and you should know why already. if you want mob justice, then you should go to whatever country is backwards enough to still be employing such a system (and spoiler - they're behind technologically). speaking of which, the values i defend are the driving forces of technology and civilized behaviour. wokeness is the reason that america is falling behind. compare crime statistics and order to japan.\", 'labels': ['conflict', 'knowledge', 'similarity', 'support', 'status', 'power', 'trust', 'identity', 'fun', 'romance'], 'scores': [0.14817270636558533, 0.12658610939979553, 0.12652358412742615, 0.11594761162996292, 0.10953325778245926, 0.10137877613306046, 0.09746891260147095, 0.0829114317893982, 0.05698114633560181, 0.034496456384658813]}\n",

the planet will be fine right up until the sun hits it's end of life. yes, but we won't. a veritable hostile wasteland hostile to whom? not the wealth of wildlife that lives there. that one item could have been an extinction level event for most of the planet. no way. it would have been catastrophic for europe and caused immense damage to humanity. plants and then animals would relatively quickly reclaim those places as we saw in the containment zone. where human activity ceases, ecological recovery occurs. seriously dude - you have no credibility here with those claims of the'benefits'or nuclear waste causing isolation areas. a. says the one who is disputing the laws of physics. b. you are literally disputing facts. chernobyl ecosystems'remarkably healthy( what does it mean to your credibility when you dispute demonstrable facts without evidence?

i don't care what ideology underlies the drive for sustainability. it's just clear that the need of capitalism for unlimited growth is the cause of the problem. capitalism and sustainability are simply incompatible. a society cannot grow indefinitely when resources are limited. it must achieve a state of balance with its ecosystem. every collapse of a civilization was caused by this simple oversight. ours will inevitably follow if we do not learn from history or science. you have been sold a bill of good believe the earth is'dying'and we have to embrace communism to survive. you have subscribed to falsehoods if you believe i have said either of those things. earth isn't dying, we are. we need to embrace sustainability to survive. i don't care how that happens. i just know capitalism caused the problem and is making it worse. that we have crossed thresholds for which there is no recovery. it's just not true. i agree. that we are heading toward a threshold with no recovery is true. we can recover, we will just fail if people like you refuse to do so. we will adapt to what comes. and that adaptation will look like a few of us remaining in pockets of areas with remaining resources scrubbing out a grubby existence in a devastated ecosystem. we can adapt proactively or reactively. i choose the former because the outcome is better. losing quality of life is inevitable. we either choose how that occurs in an orderly way or let fate decide. i'd rather design our future than hope it turns out well while doing nothing to make that happen. i have lived through tens if not hundreds of'doom and gloom'predictions. i'm sure you've lived through many tabloid renditions that confirm your preconceived notions. so far, not one has even come close to being true. imagine if scientists predicted species extinction would significantly exceed background level as the scope of human activity increases and it did.... oh wait that already happened. this is like saying i refuse to go to a doctor for medical treatment because one doctor committed malpractice on a patient.\", 'labels': ['similarity', 'support', 'trust', 'knowledge', 'identity', 'status', 'conflict', 'power', 'fun', 'romance'], 'scores': [0.12830136716365814, 0.1248209998011589, 0.1211506575345993, 0.10949993878602982, 0.10685458779335022, 0.10394631326198578, 0.10323578119277954, 0.08121584355831146, 0.06735026091337204, 0.05362430959939957]}\n",

we actually now the catalyst, you just wont'acknowledge it is human activity. not only that, there have been several significant extinction events that didn't rate'mass'status. this one is already rated a mass extinction. you are not understanding variability at all. variability is irrelevant. you are comparing events that occurred over tens of thousands of years to the same events that are unfolding over decades. this mass extinction is literally occurring faster than when a meteor struck the planet. there is no reason to believe change is'gradual'. yes there is. rapid changes have always occurred with some sort of catalyst. you are making the assumption that there is a steady rate of change and that simply is not true. it is true. we can observe it. when that rate is upset it is because of some externality. for the 5th extinction, that was a meteor. for the 6th, it is us. it requires an immense destabilizing event to upset that system. ou are arguing for a'static'earth based on recent and recent is really generous, information. not at all. i'm arguing that earth isn't static because it is affected by external forces. in this case, we can do things to mitigate the effects of that external force and maintain more predictable and gradual changes that are actually adaptable because they occur on a geological timeframe rather than the span of a few generations of humans. the stupid simplest example i can give is a hay field/meadow allowed to revert to woodland. what do you mean allowed? you one example appears to be one that is compeltely unnatural. what you are actually talking about is a deforested woodland growing back. the habitat was woodland for a long time, it was just destroyed. artificially maintaining a habitat not fit for its ecosystem requires external effort. without human activity, it would have been a woodland for a very long time and not a field. takes years to happen - not thousands of years. how long does it take a forest to become a field without human intervention? how long does it take a desert to become a rain forest without human intervention? ecosystems don't change in tens of years without external influence. the assumptions put into your concept are'bunk'. resources may be finite, but trying to claim a specific'capacity'is nothing but a politically motivated idea for what you think should be the case. i can cite the paper that listed the carrying capacity of the earth at a billion-billion people based on thermodynamics. you are welcome to make the argument that there is enough arable land, fresh water, timber, food sources, and habitable regions for a trillion humans. we can't even feed and quench everyone with 8 billion people. biocapacity observes how much mutually exclusive, biologically productive area is necessary to renew peoples demand for natural resources. current measures require 1.6 global hectares of productive area per person. you make no arguments that the assumption that people need biologically productive land to survive is bunk. you merely assert that is bunk without evidence. tell me you actually believe humans can survive without arable land, fresh water, etc. what you are trying to refer to is'carrying capacity'no, carrying capacity is a different concept than biocapacity. i'm very familiar with both. carrying capacity refers to the size limit of a species. biocapacity is a measure of how sustainably our species acts with regard to our size. it is a ratio of population to resources. that ratio changes as our practices change in addition to our population. restoration to what? why is that the'correct'habtitat? seriously. why is a specific choice better than another? the correct habitat is one which which naturally occurs, not one which is unnaturally imposed. the former is better because it allows species that evolved in their habitat to persist. when you destroy a habitat like changing a forest to a field, what do you think happens to all the forest creatures? decarbonization tells me what i need to know about your'politics'. fun fact - co2 levels are lower now than they have been the planets geologic history. fun fact. there was no life on earth when co2 levels were at their peak in geological history. so not a very good argument. also fun fact. co2 levels a higher now than they have been for the entirety of human existence. the last time co2 levels were this high was over 100,000 years ago and that happened when a comet hit what is now canada. we are literally experiencing rates of increase that happen when celestial objects hit the planet. why is it needed to'lower'them? co2 levels increase temperatures. warmer temperatures destroy ocean ecosystems by acidifying the water and requiring species to expend more energy to function. as temperatures increase, phytoplankton photosynthesis efficacy reduces until they can no longer survive. that creates a feedback loop because phytoplankton process the majority of planet's co2. the sheer rate of change means evolution won't be able to occur to adapt. rapid temperature changes cause rapid habitat loss or change, which kills off most species in that habitat. explain to me why exactly this value you want is more correct than a previous level in the planets history? the problem isn't the value, it is the rate of change. life evolves over hundreds of thousands or millions of years, not 100. dinosaurs evolved to live in a period of substantially higher co2 levels. we haven't. most life hasn't. humans can only survive above a wet bulb temperature indoors with air conditioning. when the tropics exceed that temperature (which they do already during parts of the year) it requires immense amounts of resources to keep living there. that's why we experience major migrations from the global center - people literally can't farm anymore. they can't work outside when they need to and the land won't sustain the crops. this is a total line of bull. we are part of nature and completely incapable of'breaking nature'. everything we do is'natural'. good, bad, otherwise, we are part of the planets ecosystems. it's a matter of opinion what is natural or not. whether or not our devastation of the planet's ecosystem should be considered natural is irrelevant to whether or not we should do it. i simply say we shouldn't because doing so threatens our civilization and long term access to a decent quality of life for future generations. humans have proven to be one of the most adaptable animal yet to exist on the planet. probably the most adaptable if you limit the list to larger creatures. there is little reason to believe we wouldnt survive. i think we probably would survive. our quality of life and potential for advancement would be reduced substantially. i don't think you understand just how dangerous the event was and what could have happended should that reactor have melted down through the containment and exploded when it hit groundwater. i absolutely do. it just wouldn't have made a long term difference to flora and fauna. the meltdown would have had major implications for the habitability of much of europe for humans. but i thought humans were adaptable? everything we do is natural. surely if we can survive the equivalent of a meteor hitting the planet, a nuclear disaster is survivable. or do you not believe humans are that adaptable? as for recovery - if you include dna damage - sure. but if it actually went to the'worst case'possible, it would have been a mass extinction event for much of the world. it would have been a mass death event for humans and wildlife, but as the exclusion zone proves, plants and animals will be fine. they will come back in force without humans. never mind the dna damage and the fact humans won't be able to live there for tens of thousands of years. that eating anything grown there is injesting poison. places being uninhabitable to humans and not being able to sustain human food needs? i thought we weren't concerned about that because of our supreme adaptability? why is it when i argue humans will lack habitable, arable land your argument is that we will adapt, but when you argue the same, humans are all the sudden incapable of survival?

            "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr {'sequence': \"to start, the easy way to disprove your point is that there have been some widely publicized protests that weren't really considered unacceptable at any point. someone else mentioned the women's march with the pink hats, which is a great example. it might not have achieved much, but this tells us that there is definitely some distinction in the general consciousness between acceptable and unacceptable. with that out of the way, if i understand your main point correctly, it's that since there will always be someone who thinks a protest isn't happening the right way, such criticisms aren't really valid since no protest will ever be acceptable. first off, that's not really a disprovable statement. the world's a big place full of lots of people. out of 350 million americans, there's always going to be at least one guy or group of people who holds some variation of the contrarian opinion. but that goes for any opinion. there'll always be someone who thinks a certain food is bad, but this doesn't make the opinion that food x is bad invalid, just because there could never be a food so good everyone would agree it's good. it just means that you can't just take some random asshole's word for it and have to actually listen to their arguments before making up your own mind. just like with any other opinion. also, even if people could agree on an objective standard of acceptability, there would still be people calling any protest unacceptable: the opposition. the president said kaepernick should be fired? well gee, do you think the president's issue was with the method, or with the message? kaepernick could never have protested to the opposition's satisfaction. notice how many of the republicans who are against roads being blocked for the environment were in favor of the canadian freedom convoy (and vice versa, many liberals suddenly seemed to think blocking roads was only legitimate when their cause was the one doing it). in many cases, it was never about the method, but about which cause the method is being used to defend. this doesn't make comments of the unacceptability of a protest automatically invalid: it just means that you need to filter reactionary partisanship out of your equation. there's even a cute little phenomenon that springs up around this theme: concern trolling! pretending you belong to the opposite group and expressing concerns. that's a large part of the trend you're alluding to, with many people saying things such as of course i think racial equality is important, but i just don't think x is the right way to go about it. except that person doesn't really care about racial equality, and no method would ever be right. not because they have an actual issue with the form, but because pretending it is about the method lets their objections to the protest avoid being immediately (and rightly) dismissed as a detractor's issue with the message. again, this doesn't make issues with a protest's method automatically invalid. lastly as a non-american, i can tell you that plenty of protest happens all the time in my country, and generally the only ones who are upset are whoever the opposition is that day. well, that, and the constant petty tribal infighting inherent to any group of opinionated people without a terribly strict hierarchy (ironically most of the issues with method that tend to get thrown around here is that the existing protests aren't radical and disruptive enough). i hear about those because if a protest happens in a city in my country, the news is going to pick it up almost by default. so then why aren't you hearing about those? well, i have a theory: america is big. like, stupidly big, to a point that i think even most americans don't really comprehend. in many ways, you aren't a country, you're a continent with a bunch of countries stitched together in one messy quilt. a californian might share the same language and american history classes as a south dakotan, but their culture is inevitably going to be very different. as a european, do you think i hear about the average protest going on in the neighboring countries? no, only the ones that get attention in international media. and sadly, the best way to make the media give you eyeballs is to get people angry. i suspect that the situation is somewhat similar in america: national american news has to cover 350 million people, and they're not going to pick up more local protests, or the routine protests that go smoothly from a to b. they're going to go straight to the sensational. in the much fiercer competition for american eyeballs, the protests that will tend to rise to the top of the pile will be the ones that get people upset for one reason or another (but usually at the protest). this has all kinds of consequences (perceived radicalization of benign issues, unnecessary hostile escalation of debate, a trend of chasing unacceptability, ...), but the upshot is that the protests you'll hear about will be the ones that would have the most people calling unacceptable, for legitimate or illegitimate reasons, and only ever hearing about the most polarizing protests can very well skew your perspective of how polarizing the average protest actually is.\", 'labels': ['similarity', 'conflict', 'status', 'trust', 'knowledge', 'identity', 'power', 'fun', 'support', 'romance'], 'scores': [0.20271888375282288, 0.15809082984924316, 0.11685893684625626, 0.11624909192323685, 0.10250546038150787, 0.09240473806858063, 0.07981899380683899, 0.0653824582695961, 0.044112950563430786, 0.021857716143131256]}\n",

you need food, it needs to be cheap, it needs water. rapid population reduction is the only way you can solve that problem. ww3 or sars 3 are the only practical ways to deal with that. not only are you an idiot, you're gullible to random peoples'propaganda on the internet, just like the people that voted for trump. either that, or you're being paid by oil companies to spin yet another yarn to fool people. this is a strawman. you build a position that i don't actually hold, one that's easy to defeat, then you knock it down. dogshit tier argument by a rebel without a clue. as for every industry being revolutionized digitally.... please tell me which industry is making things that people need at an affordable price for them ? the digital revolution is a description of our current era. look it up. but i get it. you can't think of an industry that doesn't rely on computing because there aren't any, so you deflected. i am not impressed. that's because you're entitled and have no idea what life was like for most of history. join a historical reenactment group and do what it takes to survive and you'll appreciate technology. none of this crap has brought the widespread prosperity that it should have. it is at best a very temporary reduction in poverty followed by the ushering in of a recession or depression that eventually is going to increase poverty over time. rubbish. you live in the most prosperous time that there has ever been. do you know hunger?

a ruling elite deciding what everyone should do and how much they should have? we tried that a few times and it didn't work out. a market naturally tends towards efficiency and giving people what they want, other systems tend towards different outcomes. markets aren't good but they're the least bad option that we've discovered so far. everyone says that they have an alternative but the reality is that labour allocation is an unsolved problem. the best we have seen so far is a hybrid between the free market and political control over its evils. european social democratic systems have pretty high standards of living (because of the free marke)t and high levels of social security; not as much wealth or freedom as the us (due to tax and regulation) but a more compassionate society (afforded by tax and regulations). i think that's probably best, but how much market and how much control and control over what and who? i'm not sure, i think that changes over time and it depends on who you ask. answering that question is what politics really is in a democracy. and like the market is for labour allocation, democracy is the worst system of government apart from all the others; it's another unsolved problem. i'm describing what really makes people happy. but of course, i don't expect sociopaths like yourself to understand that. i just happen to believe in being sociopathic towards the sociopaths - if humanity finally saw the light and decided to mass murder every sociopath, 90% of the world's problems would be solved. but human greed makes humans unbelievably stupid. so call people who disagree with you names, and use that label as an excuse to murder them?

            "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr {'sequence': \"i am 3 months late to the party but was about to post a similar post (from the opposite view point) nuclear energy has one big upside, and that is, it reduces the consumption of fossil fuels which cause many environmental ills. my counter argument in a nutshell is that nuclear power only has upsides and no downsides compared to the current state of the world energy market. the potential of an environmentally destructive disaster. there is zero environmental destructive potential. even chernobyl, the worst disaster to date, the area has recovered and animals still thrive. for humans it will be dangerous to live for 10s of thousands of years, but for the animals and wildlife who have at max a 5-10 year life span horizon its business as usual. the production of hard to store nuclear waste (which may leak and pollute the environment under extreme neglect). nuclear waste is only labeled nuclear waste by policy, not by scientific limitations on what to do with it. france and canada have a long history of taking other countries waste and recycling the fuel. the pollution caused by the extraction and processing of uranium. what pollution? uranium ore is mined from the ground same as any rare earth element. uranium is enriched by making yellow cake and running it through centrifuges. what part of this process makes you think they just chuck the rest on the ground modern nuclear security makes even large scale incidents like fukushima take a very small toil in human terms, but not necessarily so for nature. there have been absolutely zero people identified in peer reviewed scientific documentation to have been found to have died from radiation exposure or contracted anything connected to the fukushima nuclear power plant. zero. fukushima is the namesake of the disaster but the disaster was the largest earthquake ever recorded in human history which caused the largest tsunami ever recorded. 10s of thousands of peoples died from the storm surge. fukushima is not a nuclear security failure in any sense. additionally too, the other cited case of 3 mile island also had zero people die or received cancer. nuclear waste can be stored very cheaply given that its volume is minuscule. even if nuclear plants had to pay for centuries of storage in advance, they'd still the profitable. however that waste may be handled centuries down the line. nuclear fuel can and must be reprocessed, but it will take a policy overhaul to do so. because of superstition, nuclear development has been in a stand still since the 1970s. its 2023, 50 years after the last nuclear power plant was built. the uranium fission pressurized boiling water reactor is 1945 technology, the future of nuclear is thorium molten salt reactors. these reactors do not boil water under pressure, they are self regulating and efficient. the nuclear waste is unserviceable uranium pellets which still has 96% of the remaining potential power left to be utilized. molten salt reactors like the ones in canada and france can use these waste fuels and maximize power output. again i reemphasize this was technology developed in the 1970s. the contribution to climate change from the extraction and processing of uranium is minimal relative to using any fossil fuel as an alternative, this cannot be said of other forms of environmental impact caused by it. nuclear power is the only power source capable of cleanly powering industries of economic scale. not just taking the place of fossil fuels, but taking carbon out of the atmosphere. imagine a bottle of soda. carbon dioxide was pumped into that can to pressurize it and add bubble fizz. that is what is happening to our oceans. we are pumping co2 into the atmosphere faster than plants or natural processes can reclaim it. the atmospheric pressure forces this co2 into equilibrium with the earths oceans. this co2 creates carbonic acid and is killing the ocean life at an alarming rate. the unfortunate fact is that there is no substitute for liquid fuel for powering aircraft. petroleum is energy dense and is the fuel of choice for aircraft that have to lift loads of passengers and cargo but yet be light enough to fly long distances economically. the combination of these two dilemmas is what nuclear power can solve. nuclear power produces the power needed to conduct electrolysis of water on an industrial scale- separating h2o into hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon gas chains. petroleum products are just carbon chains of different lengths. so in a controlled process, you can take the co2 out of the ocean and build the liquid fuel or petroleum product you need. you keep liquid fuels, they are clean and pure without harmful chemicals like lead or sulfur, they are carbon neutral because conservation of mass the carbon they release when burned is less than the carbon that was extracted to create it. this isnt science fiction. its being done by the military at naval air station key west, florida. i believe this fundamental disagreement has led to these activists to completely avoid the topic of nuclear energy or to frame it in an unfairly negative light. manipulating the public as to get them to support a cause that largely only benefits the environment when a fully informed public would've taken a more pragmatic, human-serving and environment-neglecting pro-nuclear approach. you cant even get people to wear masks when it made sense to do so. republicans have deliberately gutted science and education in their states because its easier to win over uneducated mobs than it is literate educated professionals. the key in changing the nuclear paradigm is advertising that its 1) economically in our advantage to do so- its profitable 2) its feasible and already being done and just needs to be done at a larger scale 3) its good for the environment everything else is dribble. most people scientists. you know whats the great thing about science? it doesnt care what your opinion is- anyones opinion. science is facts. its in black and white and its a permanent record. its testable and verifiable. opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. but the science is proven, its not a leap of faith, there are 400 nuclear reactors running around the world at this very second. 10% of the global energy is met by nuclear power and it really should be 70%. where there is debate for opinion is that people are convinced that solar and wind are the future. theyll point to tables and claim its cheaper per kilowatt hour. the reality is that you cannot power a nation or economy on solar and wind alone. the phase of energy production (when sun is shining or wind is blowing) is inconsistent and doesnt line up with human work hours. the amount of valuable real estate needed per kilowatt hour is astronomical compared to nuclear which is compact. the two biggest counter arguments are the worlds largest solar farms in pakistan and the martian rovers. the largest solar farm is in pakistan and its a flop. not just a flop because its in the desert and not even capturing half the energy potential due to sand, but all the other factors such as getting the power to the people, the amount of labor needed to maintain the system, all add up to a financial fiasco. the martian rovers were the experiment to show that the future of mankind in space cannot hinge on solar power alone. the first two rovers were powered by solar but with the distance to the sun and the sandstorms, the first two rovers died out before they completed their missions. the follow on rovers use nuclear technology for constant uninterrupted power.\", 'labels': ['similarity', 'identity', 'support', 'knowledge', 'status', 'power', 'conflict', 'trust', 'fun', 'romance'], 'scores': [0.16551466286182404, 0.1406010389328003, 0.12933100759983063, 0.1243240162730217, 0.11424340307712555, 0.10736607760190964, 0.08980685472488403, 0.07874181121587753, 0.02861747518181801, 0.021453704684972763]}\n",

(similiar in some ways to the failed attempt to take kyiv) so germany was forced into alternative tactics, i.e. indiscriminate civilian attacks. however, germanies failure in attacking civilians doesn't mean that it isn't an effective strategy. the reality is that war is hell, and that large scale attacks on civilians does in fact work because: attacking civilians is how russia ultimately won in chechnya and syria... and frankly, how america got japan to surrender in wwii. while it isn't talked about much: the nuclear annihilation hiroshima and nagasaki were essentially the two events that led to imperial japans surrender. more generally, all militaries on all sides engaged in this tactic in world war ii, and many have done so post wwii. lol, you act like the flak cannon is new technology. i am not saying that it is a new technology i am saying that building an item that has no production line today is not easy, and there has been no indications that america or other western powers will do this. military support for ukraine has been with current technologies and stockpiles, assuming that will change is a leap of faith with an unknown probability.\", 'labels': ['similarity', 'conflict', 'support', 'status', 'power', 'knowledge', 'fun', 'identity', 'trust', 'romance'], 'scores': [0.3032211363315582, 0.25299975275993347, 0.1263996958732605, 0.11384018510580063, 0.07469141483306885, 0.052067700773477554, 0.026981806382536888, 0.022315746173262596, 0.020033173263072968, 0.00744949746876955]}\n",

admitting that i'm not in the war rooms of ukraine, russia, nato, or even sitting on a panel of experts. if i'm down a rabbit hole, you're approaching the core of the earth. my stance is that us commoners have very little handle on where this war is going. this is no different than even most military minds as very few of them have proven to have a grasp on what is going to come next either. war, economics, and politics is just too complicated to be able to state certainty except in extreme cases. like i can state that russia will not collapse tomorrow and neither will ukraine, but i can't say that about either country a decade from now because there are just far too many factors. to get back to the point of this cmv, i'm also no putin lover, but i was never a hater of his either. i thought the guy was the kind of strong man russian's needed after the disaster of yeltsin. russia had lost their empire and on top of that was handed a guy who as a leader was lost in the mist of how to convert russia back into a coherent nation. his idea seemed to be that they'd be able to retain a lot of the soviet leadership while at the same time transferring over to capitalism. this led to odd choices of leaders over certain sectors and taking ownership over the private sector which resulted in dramatic inefficiencies and corruption. putin came in as the more traditional sort of soviet leader. at least traditional as of the last few generation. he was a strong man who had solid control over the nation and was able to help resolve some of the problems rapidly. the prosperity and stability he brought to russia initially was obvious. even through the 2014 seizing of crimea, i thought putin was doing what was best for russia. it was a bloodless war that sort of suggested just how clear it was that crimea was a legitimate target for annexation. ukraine wasn't willing to fight for it nor was the local population. my problem with putin is that he seems to have entirely misjudged this most recent war with ukraine. prior to the war, russia had a laundry list of their own internal problems. demographic issues, economics issues, political issues, and even an upcoming succession issue when putin passed on. these were things worth focusing on. instead putin chose to invade ukraine seemingly with the idea that he'd be able to swallow it up with ease. instead he's now buried russia in a ton of long term woes ranging for even worse demographic issues as their young men are dying and fleeing russia, enormous sanctions, and a nation that will be viewed as an unreliable source of energy even by nations like china and india. sure, china and india are buying the cheap energy now, but they'd never be foolish enough to hitch their entire nation's future to those supplies after seeing what russia attempted to do with that power over europe. the same is true of nations not wanting to hitch their economy entirely on the us because the us does the same sort of stuff with tariffs and such. the difference is that the us is very diversified both in customers and products. russia is very dependent on energy sales and those sales are much harder to make given that they require long term investments in things like pipelines and you can't easily redirect. so yeah, i'm disappointed in putin. he had his faults before, but he had put russia first and done i think what needed to be done for his nation. this war has been a disaster for the long term prospects for russia. even if they win this war, ukraine is an impoverished nation even prior to the war and have even worse demographic issues than russia. taking on ukraine isn't a major benefit to any of the long term problems russia has. the one thing it might offer is a more defensible position in the case of nato aggression, but let's be real, nato was never going to invade russia. i'm trying to be pragmatic here. even a full victory in ukraine is worth very little and the costs to russia have been staggering. this was a huge miscalculation and it does make me think less of putin. for most of the rest of the points you made, i would just say both sides have instances of soldiers losing heart, equipment failures, and media engaging in a manipulation of the facts. i try to just filter those out and make up my own mind of what is going on based on larger trends. i'd lose my mind worrying about each individual claim or article being written. for soledar and bakhmut, i think you're putting too much emphasis on those if you think what is happening there is convincing. russia started out this war rapidly taking territory and those gains were quite convincing at first, but then something seemed... wrong. they started struggling and facing unexpected defeats before pulling back entirely from kyiv. they then switched to a war of attrition and at first seemed to be doing great in lysychansk and sievierodonetsk, but then again, something seemed wrong, namely that himars showed up and russia had to entirely rework their logistics and tactics which they proved incapable of as ukraine has their own string of victories and offensives. now here we are with russia again using attritional warfare, just on a more limited scale. they've reduced the front line so they can be more focused on smaller conflicts which is show initial progress, but to be fair, this success has lasted a short period of time and is limited to a few hundred square kilometers. considering they lost over ten thousand square kilometers in the ukraine offensives, they've got a lot of ground to make up. i'm just going to sit back and watch how this develops. russia isn't going to crush ukraine in the coming days or months so we'll see a spring offensive by both sides and likely a summer offensive. those will be much more rapid moving than what we're seeing right now. if russia can continue their current success, then it should speed up a lot in the next six months which might allow them to achieve a victory of sorts. then again, we might see more stagnation at the front line or even ukrainian victories with new western equipment. we'll just have to wait and see how things progress. history shows us just how long and unpredictable wars can be and considering how balanced this war is, i really doubt we can start planning the victory parades for either side just yet. lol,
